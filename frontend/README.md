# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

Welcome to the Joke Generator I made for Frontmen which uses the mighty Chuck Norris and all the legends around his persona.

This generator exists of both a frontend and a backend. The frontend allows you to view and favorite some of the best jokes in the universe. The backend is used to reroute requests to the legendary joke source. The frontend is made with Angular and can be run with a simple command in this folder `npm run start` or `ng serve`. It requires a `npm install` as well to get all dependencies in order.

It requires the backend to run on port 3000 to get the jokes.
